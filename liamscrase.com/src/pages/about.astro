        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          Hey there! I’m <strong>Liam Scrase</strong>, a digital designer and
          front-end developer based in New Zealand. I love creating playful,
          colorful, and thoughtful digital experiences.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>
          I specialize in responsive design, accessible front-end development,
          and crafting clean interfaces using tools like Astro, JavaScript, and
          CSS. When I’m not coding, I enjoy experimenting with art in a
          caricature-style, exploring local design, and collaborating on creative
          projects.
        </p>

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>
          Every project starts with empathy — understanding the problem before
          diving into pixels or code. My goal is to make digital experiences both
          functional and delightful.
