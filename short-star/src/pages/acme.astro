            As the digital designer on this project, I worked closely with the
            project manager and software development team in order to create a
            design that could work functionally at all screen sizes.

            To be able to increase our reach, we needed an overhaul of our

          <p>
            Motorcentral has over has designed and built over 600 websites for
            car dealerships in New Zealand. As you might expect, there comes a
            point where there just aren’t enough clients left locally. Moving
            abroad is the next logical step, but in order to do that, we needed
            to step up or game.

            The latest version of Acme brings powerful new capabilities designed
            to enhance both the customer experience and dealership operations.
            From AI-powered content generation to intuitive search
            functionality, these features represent a significant leap forward
            in automotive website technology.

                  One of the standout features of Acme 5.0 is the integration of

                  models, each vehicle listing automatically generates a
                  comprehensive, engaging description that highlights key
                  features, specifications, and unique selling points. This not
                  only saves dealerships countless hours of manual content
                  creation but also ensures consistent, high-quality information
                  for every vehicle on the lot.

            After designing the Acme 5.0 template, I built and deployed these
            websites for dealerships throughout New Zealand. Each site is
            customized to match the dealer's brand while maintaining the core
            features and user experience of the Acme template.
