            As the digital designer on this project, I worked closely with the
            project manager and software development team in order to create a
            design that could work functionally at all screen sizes.

            To be able to increase our reach, we needed an overhaul of our

            Motorcentral has over has designed and built over 600 websites for
            car dealerships in New Zealand. As you might expect, there comes a
            point where there just aren’t enough clients left locally. Moving
            abroad is the next logical step, but in order to do that, we needed
            to step up or game.

            One of the standout features of Acme 5.0 is the integration of AI-generated vehicle descriptions. Using advanced language models, each vehicle listing automatically generates a comprehensive, engaging description that highlights key features, specifications, and unique selling points. This not only saves dealerships countless hours of manual content creation but also ensures consistent, high-quality information for every vehicle on the lot.

          <p>
            Traditional car search filters often overwhelm users with technical jargon and endless options. Acme 5.0 takes a different approach by introducing lifestyle-oriented categories and intuitive quick filters. Customers can browse by vehicle type, popular features, or specific use cases—whether they're looking for a family SUV, an eco-friendly commuter, or a weekend adventure vehicle. The streamlined filtering system gets customers to their ideal car faster, improving conversion rates and customer satisfaction.
